# Simple Text-To-Speech

simple voice chat text to speech mod

## Contributing
This mod won't work without libespeakng.dll and espeak-ng-data in the native folder in the client resources.
You can get those by installing espeak-ng (the current version of the mod uses [release 1.52](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/tag/1.52.0)) and then copying libspeakng.dll and espeak-ng-data from the install folder to the natives folder.

## TODO
- UI
- Linux/Mac support
- more advanced SSML
- kasane teto voice (if I can figure out how to make voices for espeak)
- Config
- etc
